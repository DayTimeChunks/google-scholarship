# MyReads Project

    
## Project description

This is version 1 of "MyReads: A Book Tracking App", the first of two final assessment projects for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 
The goal was to add interactivity to the skeleton app by refactoring the static code provided in this [template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git).

This project has been bootstrapped with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Versions

- master
    
    This version has no throttle or debounce and was used for project submission.
    
Implementation of throttle and debounce take information from [here](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/how-to-throttle-and-debounce-an-autocomplete-input-in-react). 
Versions implementing these functions are not included in the repository yet, but can if anyone requests. 

Branch names (only for reference on my local machine):
    
- `throttle-myreads` (throttle only)

- `debounce-myreads` (debounce only)

- `throtdeb-myreads` (includes both throttle and debounce).
