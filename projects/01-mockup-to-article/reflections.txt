You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:

  * What new skills have you learned?

Adequate use of elements. Although I knew about these I wasn’t using them properly before nor what each element stood for.  Now I am using them better and it is helping avoid too many line breaks ‘<br>’ everywhere!!  

Also, learned about the target="_blank" on links used to open links in a new tab, which is nice if you want to keep reading the article after finishing the link. 

Finally, with a good basis on CSS I have begun exploring bootstrap. I must say I am a fan of standard libraries, but not sure what is the consensus on using it. I started working on a second project and using bootstrap has made me move super quick through the development. :D Your thoughts on the use of bootstrap?

  * What has been easy / difficult?

I agree with @Joey_A , nothing has been easy or hard, just more challenging at some points. 

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

The MDN web docs have become handy and this forum has been awesome to solve problems! :)
