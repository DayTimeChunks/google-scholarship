      			<p>Lazlo is an overweight anthropomorphic orange tabby noted for his laziness, smug sarcasm, and intense passion for food, particularly chilaquiles and tortas. Throughout his life, Lazlo's weight has been an object of ridicule, particularly by his talking electronic scale. Lazlo does not handle critiques or commands very well, and will tend to respond to such remarks with disdain, a comeback of some type and, on bad days, with measured violence.</p>
