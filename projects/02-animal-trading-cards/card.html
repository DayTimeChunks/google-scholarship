			<p>Cucho is an overweight anthropomorphic orange tabby noted for his laziness, smug sarcasm, and intense passion for food, particularly pizza, and ice cream. Throughout the course of his life, Cucho's weight has been an object of ridicule, particularly by his talking electronic scale. Cucho usually does not handle insults or commands from the scale (or anybody else) very well, and will normally respond to such remarks with violence or a comeback of some type.</p>
