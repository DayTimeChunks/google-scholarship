## Instructions

1. Match cards with identical icons

2. You have unlimited number of moves. However, the more moves you take, the less final stars you will have, and the lower your score.

Your final score will be:  

$Final$ $Score$ = Pairs Matched \times 2 \times Number of Stars


3. You will also be timed, but this does not affect your score! The timer starts inly after you open the first card.

## Implements

This game is made only with JavaScript (no jQuery was used). Adaptations to functions found on W3Schools and stackoverflow.com are linked in the source code, which you can see via the browser developer tools.
