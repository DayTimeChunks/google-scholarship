# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

1. Match cards with identical icons
2. You have unlimited number of moves. However, the more moves you take, the less final stars you will have, and the lower your score.
Your final score will be:  

    *Final Score = Pairs Matched* • 2 • *Number of Stars*

3. You will also be timed, but this does not affect your score! The timer starts only after you open the first card!
