# Ajax

This folder contains three completed lessons dealing with three different methods to handle asynchronous requests.

* the XHR object (lesson 1)
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method (lesson 2)
* the Fetch API (lesson 3)

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.

## Instructions

There are no special instructions for this project. However, the state of the art in making Async requests is by chaining `Promises` with the **Fetch API** in lesson 3.
